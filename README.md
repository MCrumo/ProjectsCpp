# C++ Projects Repository
This repository contains a set of projects developed using the C++ programming language. The projects included in this repository are:

## SudokuSolver
>This project is a program that receives an incomplete Sudoku and, through a backtracking algorithm, finds the solutions for that Sudoku. The program can solve both easy and hard Sudoku puzzles.

## TicTacToe_AI
>This project is a C++ implementation of the popular game "Tic Tac Toe" (also known as "Three in a row"). The game features an option for two-player gameplay and a single-player mode against an AI. The game is developed to be played in the terminal. The AI algorithm uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to choose the best move in each turn.
